      <p>
        I am a full stack developer with a passion for learning new technologies
        and building applications. I have a background in business and
        entrepreneurship, which has helped me to develop a strong work ethic and
        a desire to always be improving. I am currently working on a few personal
        projects and am looking for a full time position as a developer.
